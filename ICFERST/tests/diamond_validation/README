A common question arises from developers:

'My .flml is being failed by buildbot in diamond_validation; what can I do
about this and what does it mean?'

What it means is that during diamond's automatic validation of an flml file
(see http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/index.php?title=Spud#Diamond ) against a supplied
schema an error has been raised to let you know that the XML you have provided
is invalid for your current schema.

You can easily find out what the error is by loading the flml file yourself
into diamond (having opened the relevant schema where necessary). It is advised
that you make this part of your workflow before submitting updated or new flml
files for buildbot tests, and check the x86_64-gcc4 buildtest which runs
diamond_validation in the medium-test suite to verify that your flml is in fact
valid.
