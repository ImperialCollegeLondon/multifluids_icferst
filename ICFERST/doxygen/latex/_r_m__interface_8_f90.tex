The motivation for this method is the mixing of solutions in wells, where it may be necessary to calculate solution properties (pH for example) or react the mixture to form scale minerals. The code fragments below make a mixture of concentrations and then calculate the pH of the mixture. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em M\+PI only. Defines a callback function that allows additional tasks to be done by the workers. The method R\+M\+\_\+\+Mpi\+Worker contains a loop, where the workers receive a message (an integer), run a function corresponding to that integer, and then wait for another message. R\+M\+\_\+\+Set\+Mpi\+Worker\+Callback allows the developer to add another function that responds to additional integer messages by calling developer-\/defined functions corresponding to those integers. R\+M\+\_\+\+Mpi\+Worker calls the callback function when the message number is not one of the Phreeqc\+RM message numbers. Messages are unique integer numbers. Phreeqc\+RM uses integers in a range beginning at 0. It is suggested that developers use message numbers starting at 1000 or higher for their tasks. The callback function calls a developer-\/defined function specified by the message number and then returns to R\+M\+\_\+\+Mpi\+Worker to wait for another message. ~\newline
~\newline
 For Fortran, the functions that are called from the callback function can use U\+SE statements to find the data necessary to perform the tasks, and the only argument to the callback function is an integer message argument. {\itshape R\+M\+\_\+\+Set\+Mpi\+Worker\+Callback} must be called by each worker before R\+M\+\_\+\+Mpi\+Worker is called. ~\newline
~\newline
 The motivation for this method is to allow the workers to perform other tasks, for instance, parallel transport calculations, within the structure of R\+M\+\_\+\+Mpi\+Worker. The callback function can be used to allow the workers to receive data, perform transport calculations, and (or) send results, without leaving the loop of R\+M\+\_\+\+Mpi\+Worker. Alternatively, it is possible for the workers to return from R\+M\+\_\+\+Mpi\+Worker by a call to R\+M\+\_\+\+Mpi\+Worker\+Break by root. The workers could then call subroutines to receive data, calculate transport, and send data, and then resume processing Phreeqc\+RM messages from root with another call to R\+M\+\_\+\+Mpi\+Worker. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

 To convert from mg/L to moles of element in the representative volume of a reaction cell, mg/L is converted to mol/L and multiplied by the solution volume, which is the product of porosity (R\+M\+\_\+\+Set\+Porosity), saturation (R\+M\+\_\+\+Set\+Saturation), and representative volume (R\+M\+\_\+\+Set\+Representative\+Volume).
