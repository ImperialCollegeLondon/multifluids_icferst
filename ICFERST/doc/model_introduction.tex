\section{Introduction}
The next generation multi-phase flow models within the 
CFD model FLUIDITY are outlined here. 
FLUIDITY is a next generation fully unstructured mesh multi-phase model. Its next generation will include the ability to dynamically change its resolution (adapte the mesh) in response to the physics demands as well as user guidance. It already has some of the most advanced numerical methods in computational physics. Here the long term strategy is outlined in order to help ensure long term alignment of joint work
