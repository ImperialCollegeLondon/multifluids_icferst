\chapter{Getting started}\label{chap:gettingstarted}

\section{Introduction} This first chapter gives a brief guide to setting-up,
running and visualising simulations. It is assumed that you have access to a
system running Linux or UNIX with all the \fluidity\ supporting libraries
installed; if not, you may wish to reference appendix \ref{chap:external} which
contains detailed information for your systems administrator to help setting up
a Linux workstation. 

\section{Obtaining \fluidity}
\label{sect:obtaining_fluidity}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sect:obtaining_fluidity_overview}

\fluidity\ is primarily distributed as source code, which takes the form of
instructions that are passed through a compiler to generate binary files that
your operating system can run. If you come from a UNIX background you will
probably be used to this form of distribution; if however you come from a
Windows or Mac background you may be used to programs being distributed as
pre-compiled packages which you need do nothing more than put in place and run.
There are obvious benefits to the ready-to-run approach, namely that they do
not generally require you to install any more software other than the specific
program you want, and they have a very short lead-time before you are up and
running. However, there are a number of obvious disadvantages, particularly that
making any changes to the program you have just received is extremely
difficult, and there is an underlying assumption that the computer you run the
program on will be substantially the same as the computer the program was
compiled on.

For the majority of \fluidity\ users the disadvantages of pre-compiled binaries
will outweigh the benefits, and distribution of source code is the best
solution. Indeed, even if you receive a copy of \fluidity\ as a pre-compiled
binary, the licence (LGPL) under which \fluidity\ is distributed requires that
the original source code is also made available.

\fluidity\ is a very actively developed code. The code is distributed both via
released source archives (gzipped tarballs) and through Subversion (SVN). If
you are not familiar with subversion you may be familiar with CVS (Concurrent
Versions System) and in that case transitioning to using subversion should be a
painless process as the syntax is virtually identical.

\subsection{\fluidity\ source packages}

\fluidity\ is released as compressed source archives which can be downloaded
from links on the \fluidity\ homepage,
\href{http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/Fluidity}{http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/Fluidity} .

You can download just the source, or you can download extra archives containing
examples, standard tests, and long tests.

To uncompress the \fluidity\ 4.0-release source from an archive file in Linux,
run:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
tar -zxvf fluidity-4.0.tar.gz
\end{lstlisting}

This should create a directory, \lstinline[language=Bash]+fluidity-4.0/+,
containing your copy of the source code. To add examples, standard tests, or
long tests, download the relevent archive into the
\lstinline[language=Bash]+fluidity-4.0/+ directory, and in that directory run
(in the case of examples):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
tar -zxvf fluidity-examples-4.0.tar.gz
\end{lstlisting}

The files will appear in an \lstinline[language=Bash]+examples/+ directory in
this case, or for standard tests \lstinline[language=Bash]+tests/+ and long
tests \lstinline[language=Bash]+longtests/+.

\subsection{Subversion}
\label{sect:subversion}\index{subversion|primary}\index{svn|see{subversion}}

For experienced subversion users, the relevant information that you need to
obtain a copy of \fluidity\ is that it the latest development version is
available from
\lstinline[language=Bash]+http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/svn/fluidity/trunk+ .  For
inexperienced users, or those wanting a more stable version than the
development trunk, please read on to learn how to obtain a copy of \fluidity.

As a \fluidity\ user you need only be aware of two modes of operation that
subversion has. The first is checking out a copy of the source code from the
central repository, the second is updating your copy of the code to reflect
changes that have been made to the central repository. Think of the repository
as a central archive of source code held on the main \fluidity\ servers.

There are a few other useful features for users which subversion has which will
be mentioned in passing.

Details of how to commit changes to \fluidity\ back into the central repository
are outside the scope of this user manual; if you are transitioning to become a
developer who commits changes back into \fluidity\ please contact an existing
\fluidity\ developer to find out how to get commit privileges.

A point of terminology - \textit{tags} will be referred to throughout this
section. Think of these as index entries which point to specific versions of
\fluidity. Some are permanent, some periodically change to point do different
positions.

\subsubsection{Checking out a current copy of \fluidity}
\index{subversion}
\label{sect:subversion_checkout_current}

\fluidity\ can be obtained in three forms: release, stable, and trunk.

The first, release, is aimed at general users of \fluidity. Releases have
unique, tagged version numbers, and an individual version tag will never change
content. New versions will be produced whenever there is sufficient demand for
new features to be included. It is very well tested and does not contain any
code known to have bugs. As such, code under development may be removed, and
the latest features may not be present. The manual and other resources are
written to support release.

The second, stable, is aimed at users who require access to development code
but do not wish to be exposed to the frequent but transitory issues that tend
to occur in bleeding-edge \fluidity. Nothing is removed from stable, but it is
only updated when all tests within \fluidity\ pass. It will generally be
updated on a weekly to fortnightly basis, but may go longer between updates
during periods of particularly intense development. There are no guarantees
that subtle bugs will not make it through to stable, nor that all features
present are fully functional. The manual may not be fully up to date for
stable.

The third, trunk, is the day to day development version of \fluidity. It is
primarily used by developers and is not recommended for everyday users. Updates
appear many times each day, and the trunk will frequently have periods where
not all tests are passing. Use at your own risk.

To check out a copy of \fluidity\ you can use one of the following three
commands for the release, stable and trunk versions respectively, which 
are given here in entirety but will be broken down in the subsequent 
discussion so you can better understand them.

Release:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn co http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/svn/fluidity/tags/release-4.0 fluidity/
\end{lstlisting}

Stable:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn co http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/svn/fluidity/tags/stable-trunk fluidity/
\end{lstlisting}

Trunk:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn co http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/svn/fluidity/trunk/ fluidity/
\end{lstlisting}

The first part of this command calls the svn program:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn
\end{lstlisting}

svn takes a first argument which describes the mode in which it will run. In
this case, it is going to check out a copy of the code, which abbreviates to
\lstinline[language=Bash]+co+ :

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn co
\end{lstlisting}

The second argument to svn describes the method used to check out \fluidity,
where to find the repository which holds \fluidity, and where in the repository
the up-to-date version of \fluidity\ is located. In this case, it uses the
hypertext transfer protocol (http) which you will have come across being used
to retrieve web pages, from the server
\lstinline[language=Bash]+amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk+ on which the stable version of
\fluidity\ is in the directory
\lstinline[language=Bash]+/svn/fluidity/tags/stable-trunk/+
:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn co http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/svn/fluidity/tags/stable-trunk
\end{lstlisting}

This is now a valid command line, and if you ran it would check out a copy of
\fluidity\ into a directory \lstinline[language=Bash]+stable-trunk/+ in your
current directory. If you prefer to have the code checked out into a directory
called \lstinline[language=Bash]+fluidity/+, append that directory name to the
end of the command line so svn checks out the code where you want it to:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn co http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/svn/fluidity/tags/stable-trunk/ fluidity/
\end{lstlisting}

Bear in mind that the \fluidity\ check out is of the order of many hundreds of
megabytes and should be checked out onto a file system which has corresponding
amounts of free space. As it checks out, subversion should print a lot of file
listing information along the lines of:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
A    fluidity/initialisation
\end{lstlisting}

The leading \lstinline[language=Bash]+A+ is svn's way of telling you that it is
is adding files to your local copy of the source code.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
Checked out revision 11816.
\end{lstlisting}

The revision number you get will differ from the one quoted here, and is a
specific version (the latest, at the point of checking out) of the \fluidity\
code.

It is worth noting that the revision number changes on a daily basis as it
represents how many changes have happened throughout the entire \fluidity\
repository. Thus, if you have checked out the stable-trunk tag one day and
check it out the next day onto a different computer, it is likely that you
will get the same files but with a different revision number. This is because
changes have been made to the trunk, in the same overall repository, hence
the revision number has been increased.

\subsubsection{Checking out an older copy of \fluidity}
\label{sect:subversion_checkout_old}

There may be occasions when you want to retrieve a version of \fluidity\ which
isn't the latest one. Perhaps you want to retrieve a particular version for the
purposes of benchmarking.

You may either choose to check out a specific revision, or have been told a
revision number to check out. To do this, for the example of revision 11816,
add in the argument \lstinline[language=Bash]+-r 11816+ to give:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn co -r 11816 http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/svn/fluidity/trunk/ fluidity/
\end{lstlisting}

Alternatively, you may either want or be told to check out a specific
\fluidity\ tag. A tag, as mentioned earlier, is a useful method of identifying
a particular \fluidity\ revision using an easy to remember name, and
potentially making further specifications of exactly what will be checked out.
For example, you may be asked to check out the
\lstinline[language=Bash]+benchmark-9.10+ tag, and to do this you would change
the location within the repository you are checking out from to be
\lstinline[language=Bash]+/svn/fluidity/tags/benchmark-9.10/+ rather than
\lstinline[language=Bash]+/svn/fluidity/trunk/+ . Your svn command would look
like:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn co http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/svn/fluidity/tags/benchmark-9.10/ fluidity/
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Updating your copy of \fluidity}
\index{subversion}
\label{sect:subversion_updating}

If you are interested in keeping up to date with the latest developments in
\fluidity\ you will probably want to update your local copy of the \fluidity\
code to reflect changes made to the central source code repository. To do this,
change directory so that you are in the directory which you checked out
\fluidity\ to (in the above case, a directory called
\lstinline[language=Bash]+fluidity/+) and then run svn's update command, which
is abbreviated to \lstinline[language=Bash]+up+ as per:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn up
\end{lstlisting}

You will probably see a number of lines with a leading
\lstinline[language=Bash]+U+, denoting that a file in your local copy of
\fluidity\ is being updated, such as:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
U    preprocessor/Populate_State.F90
\end{lstlisting}

If you have made no changes to your local copy of \fluidity\ you will rarely
have any problems updating unless a particularly complicated change has been
made to the central source code repository. However, if you have made changes
to your local copy of \fluidity, you may see lines with a leading
\lstinline[language=Bash]+G+, denoting that a locally changed file has had
central repository changes merged into it in a good way:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
G    preprocessor/Populate_State.F90
\end{lstlisting}

This is generally the case when you have edited a different part of the file
than has been changed in the central repository. However, if you have edited
the same line as has changed in the central repository you may see a leading
\lstinline[language=Bash]+C+, denoting a conflict between your changes and the
central changes:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
C    preprocessor/Populate_State.F90
\end{lstlisting}

At this point you can either discard your local changes by removing the file in
conflict (losing any of your own changes) and running another update to get the
latest version:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
rm preprocessor/Populate_State.F90*
svn up
\end{lstlisting}

or you can attempt to resolve the conflict. Resolving conflicts between local
and central changes moves you into the realms of becoming a developer and is
outside the scope of this manual, but if you are interested in learning more
about subversion an excellent and comprehensive reference book is freely
available from http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ .

\subsubsection{Other useful subversion commands}
\index{subversion}
\label{sect:subversion_extras}

If you can check out and update your copy of \fluidity\ then you are equipped to
be an active \fluidity\ user. However, you may wish to know about a few more
useful subversion commands, including getting information about your local
version of the code using:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn info
\end{lstlisting}

You may well want to do this if someone asks you which version of \fluidity\ you
are using, at which point you're looking for a line such as:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
Revision: 11816
\end{lstlisting}

with the relevant information. If you only want to know the version of
\fluidity\ you're using, a shortcut command to give this is
\lstinline[language=Bash]+svnversion+.

To get information on what files have been modified in your
local copy use the the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn status -q
\end{lstlisting}

Note that adding \lstinline[language=Bash]+-q+ will not list files that are in
the directory but not in the repository - configuring and compiling produce a
lot of files, so if you leave off the \lstinline[language=Bash]+-q+ you will
see a great deal of lines starting with \lstinline[language=Bash]+?+ which
subversion knows nothing about.

To get specific information on the difference between a local file and
the central repository use the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
svn diff <filename>
\end{lstlisting}

replacing \lstinline[language=Bash]+<filename>+ with the file you want
differences reported for.

If you wish to delve deeper into subversion operation, an excellent source of
detail is \lstinline[language=Bash]+http://svnbook.red-bean.com/+ which
contains almost everything you'll ever need to know about subversion.

\section{Building \fluidity}
\label{sect:building_fluidity}

The build process for \fluidity\ comprises a configuration stage and a compile
stage. In the simplest form, this can be completed with two commands, run in
the directory containing your local source code check out, which is denoted
by \fluiditysourcepath in this manual:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
cd `\fluiditysourcepath' 
./configure
make
\end{lstlisting}

You may often only wish to perform this basic build, but sometimes you will
want more fine-grained control over the configuration procedure or you will
want to perform non-default compilation steps. The following section describes
these procedures.

Note that at this point configuration refers to the build-time configuration
options which define how the \fluidity\ program will be compiled, and do not
refer to configuration of the options that you will run \fluidity\ with once it 
has built. However, presence or lack of features configured at the build stage
may change what is available to you at run time.

It is assumed throughout this section that you are in the top-level directory
of your local copy of the \fluidity\ code for the purposes of describing
configuration and compilation commands.

\subsection{Setting up the build environment}

Depending on the computer you are building \fluidity\ on, you may need to set
up the build environment before configuring \fluidity. On the standard
\fluidity\ workstation built around Ubuntu Linux, you will need to initialise
the PETSc package by running:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
module load petsc-gcc4
\end{lstlisting}

This is very specific to the standard \fluidity\ workstation, and other systems
may well have detailed requirements to be carried out before building
\fluidity. If you are in any doubt, stop now, and consult with your local
systems administrator who should be able to help you resolve any problems ahead
of time. If you are not on a standard \fluidity\ workstation you may want to
refer to (or refer your systems administrator to) appendix \ref{chap:external}
of this manual before proceeding.

The build environment is discussed in more detail in sections
\ref{sect:configure_locate_supporting_libs} and
\ref{sect:configure_environment_vars}.

\subsection{Configuring the build process}
\label{sect:configuring_the_build_process}

For a full list of the build-time configuration options available in fluidity,
run:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
./configure --help
\end{lstlisting}

Key configuration options are described here, but you are advised to check
output from the above command for any changed or new options which may have
been introduced since the last update of this manual.

Where you wish to specify multiple configuration options at once, supply them
all on the same configuration command line, separated by spaces. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
./configure --prefix=/data/fluidity --enable-debugging
\end{lstlisting}

Note that there is one key option NOT enabled by default which users running
the \fluidity\ examples will need to enable to make all examples work. This is 
\lstinline[language=Bash]+--enable-2d-adaptivity+ , which cannot be turned on
as a default as it makes use of external code that is not license-compatible
with all other \fluidity\ codes. Hence, it is a reasonable default state for
you to run:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
./configure --enable-2d-adaptivity
\end{lstlisting}

We'll go on now to discussing enabling and disabling features.

\subsubsection{Enabling and disabling features}
\label{sect:configure_enable_disable_features}

\fluidity\ has a number of optional features which may be enabled or disabled at
build time. For a list of all these features see the output of configuring with
the \lstinline[language=Bash]+--help+ argument. This list should indicate which
options are enabled by default by appending
\lstinline[language=Bash]+(default)+ to the option description. An example of
enabling \fluidity's debugging feature at build time would be:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
./configure --enable-debugging
\end{lstlisting}

Whilst a number of options have the facility to be enabled and disabled, doing
so may be prejudicial to the expected normal running of \fluidity\ so unless you
are fully aware of the consequences of enabling or disabling features it is
recommended that you do not do so.

\subsubsection{Specifying locations of supporting libraries}
\label{sect:configure_locate_supporting_libs}

\fluidity\ requires many supporting libraries, which can either be provided via
environment variables (see later discussion for how to do this) or, in specific
cases, provided via options during configuration. This uses the
\lstinline[language=Bash]+--with+ option, for example specifying the directory
containing BLAS using:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
./configure --with-blas-dir=/data/libraries/netlib/BLAS
\end{lstlisting}

Whilst there is also the option to supply \lstinline[language=Bash]+--without+
arguments, this is likely to be highly prejudicial to the normal running of
\fluidity\ or, in many cases, be incompatible with building \fluidity\ such that
the configuration exits with an error.

\subsubsection{Environment variables set for configuration}
\label{sect:configure_environment_vars}

A description of environment variables is outside the scope of this manual, and
\fluidity\ users are encouraged to find an experienced UNIX user who can explain
the rudiments of environment variables to them if they are not already familiar
with how to set and use them. Influential environment variables are listed
towards the end of the help output from \fluidity's configuration. Particularly
notable are:

\lstinline[language=Bash]+LIBS+, which allows passing a series of linker
arguments such as \lstinline[language=Bash]+"-L/data/software/libs"+ describing
how to access libraries at link-time. This will often be set or appended to by
loading modules on modern UNIX systems.

\lstinline[language=Bash]+FCFLAGS+ and \lstinline[language=Bash]+FFLAGS+ which
describe flags passed to the Fortran and Fortran77 compilers respectively and
allow you broad control of the overall the build process. This will also often
be set or appended to by loading modules on modern UNIX systems.

\lstinline[language=Bash]+PETSC_DIR+ defines the base directory into which your
PETSc install has been placed. This will often be set by loading an environment
module specific to your system, but if you have a local build of PETSc you may
need to set this variable yourself. Note that for most \fluidity\ users, having
PETSc to provide solver functionality is unavoidable so setting this variable
by some means is necessary in almost all cases. The standard \fluidity\
workstation allows you to do this by running
\lstinline[language=Bash]+module load petsc-gcc4+ .

\lstinline[language=Bash]+VTK_INCLUDE+ and \lstinline[language=Bash]+VTK_LIBS+
may be important to set if VTK is not installed at a system level. VTK is
critical to \fluidity\ for writing output files, and many UNIX systems lack some
VTK components so it frequently ends up installed in a nonstandard location.

\subsection{Compiling \fluidity}
\label{sect:compiling_fluidity}

Once you have successfully configured \fluidity, you need to compile the source
code into binary files including programs and libraries. In the simplest form
you can do this by running:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
make
\end{lstlisting}

which will generate \fluidity\ and Diamond programs in the
\lstinline[language=Bash]+bin/+ directory and a set of libraries in the
\lstinline[language=Bash]+lib/+ directory. 

If you have a modern, powerful computer then you can speed this process up
significantly by parallelising the make, running:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
make -j
\end{lstlisting}

Note that this is very resource-intensive and whilst most modern workstations
should be equal to the task it should not be run on shared machines (ie, login
nodes of compute clusters) or systems with smaller quantities of memory.

If you want to build the extended set of \fluidity\ tools which supplement the
main \fluidity\ program, section \ref{sect:fltools}, run:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
make fltools
\end{lstlisting}

If this is the first time you have run \fluidity\ on your computer and you want
to check that it has built correctly, you can run the included suite of test
problems at three levels. The shortest tests test individual units of code for
correctness and can be run with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
make unittest
\end{lstlisting}

To run the suite of short test cases which more extensively test the
functionality of your \fluidity\ build, run:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
make test
\end{lstlisting}

For the most comprehensive set of tests included in your checked out copy of
\fluidity, run:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
make mediumtest
\end{lstlisting}

If you have obtained \fluidity\ through source archives rather than through
subversion you will need to have also downloaded and unpacked the standard
tests archive to be able to run \lstinline[language=Bash]+make test+ and
\lstinline[language=Bash]+make mediumtest+ .

Note that even on the most modern systems
\lstinline[language=Bash]+make mediumtest+ may take on the order of an hour and
on slower systems may take on the order of many hours to complete.


\section{Running \fluidity}
\label{sect:running_fluidity}


\subsection{Running \fluidity\ in serial}
\label{sect:running_fluidity_in_serial}

To run \fluidity\ in serial use the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
`\fluiditysourcepath'/bin/fluidity foo.flml
\end{lstlisting}

Here, \lstinline[language=Bash]+foo.flml+ is a \fluidity\ configuration file
which defines the options for the model. These files are covered in detail in 
Chapter \ref{chap:configuration} and are set up using a simple Graphical User
Interface, Diamond. See section \ref{sect:running_diamond} for more information 
on how to run Diamond.

There are other options that can be passed to the \fluidity\ executable. A full
list can be obtained by running:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
`\fluiditysourcepath'/bin/fluidity
\end{lstlisting}

This will produce the following output:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]

Note that this also gives information on which version is being used, the
build-time configuration options used and a list of command-line options for
\fluidity. 

Running \fluidity\ will produce several output files. See Chapter \ref{chap:visualisation_and_diagnostics}
for more information.

\subsection{Running \fluidity\ in parallel}
\label{sect:running_fluidity_in_parallel}
\index{parallel}

\fluidity\ is a fully-parallel program, capable of running on thousands of
processors.  It uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library to communicate
information between processors. Running \fluidity\ in parallel requires that
MPI is available on your system and is properly configured. The terminology for
parallel processing can sometime be confusing.  Here, we use the term
\emph{processor} to mean one physical CPU core and \emph{process} is one part
of a parallel instance of \fluidity. Normally, the number of processors used
matches the number of processes, i.e. if \fluidity\ is split into 256 parts, it
is run on 256 processors.

To run in parallel one must first decompose the mesh. See section
\ref{decomp_meshes_parallel} for more information on how to do this. \fluidity\
must then be run within the mpirun or mpiexec framework. Simply prepend the
normal command line with mpiexec: \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash] mpiexec -n
[PROCESSES] `\fluiditysourcepath'/bin/fluidity foo.flml \end{lstlisting}

\section{Running diamond}
\label{sect:running_diamond}
\index{Diamond}

Diamond is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) by which a \fluidity\ simulation
is configured. The flml file that \fluidity\ uses is an XML file, which defines
the meshes, fields and options for \fluidity. Chapter \ref{chap:configuration}
covers the options that are currently available. In addition, Diamond will
display inline help on options where available.

If the \lstinline[language=Bash]+make+ command successfully completed, there
will be an executable program \lstinline[language=Bash]+diamond+ in the
\lstinline[language=Bash]+bin/+ directory. Running diamond is now as simple as
typing:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
`\fluiditysourcepath'/bin/diamond
\end{lstlisting}

If the \lstinline[language=Bash]+make install+ command completed and a directory
which executable programs were installed into to the
\lstinline[language=Bash]+PATH+ environment variable, one may also be able to run
diamond simply by typing \lstinline[language=Bash]+diamond+ at the command line
from any directory on your system. This may also be possible if the
Diamond package for Ubuntu or Debian is installed by running:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
sudo apt-get install diamond
\end{lstlisting}

Note that installing Diamond on a system-wide basis will require superuser privileges on the system.

\section{Working with the output}
\label{sect:working_with_output}

Once \fluidity\ has been built and run, result files will be generated, that
will need visualising and post-processing. These data are stored in VTK files,
one per output dump.  How these files can be visualised and post-processed is
covered in detail in chapter \ref{chap:visualisation_and_diagnostics}.

As well as visualisation, another important output resource is the stat file,
