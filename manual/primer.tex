\chapter*{Fluidity Primer}
% \pagenumbering{roman} \setcounter{page}{}

This is a one-page primer for obtaining \fluidity and running a simple example. It assumes that:

\begin{itemize}
\item You are running Ubuntu Linux, release 10.10 (Maverick) or newer
\item You have administrative rights on your computer
\item You know how to run a terminal with a command prompt
\item You have a directory in which you can create files
\end{itemize}

Set up your computer to access the Fluidity repository by typing:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fluidity-core/ppa
\end{lstlisting}

Type your password when prompted, and press enter if required to confirm
adding the repsitory.

Once this completes, update your system and install \fluidity along with its
supporting software by typing:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fluidity
\end{lstlisting}

Confirm the install by pressing 'y' when requested.

Uncompress the packaged examples to a directory in which you can create files (in this example, \lstinline[language=Bash]+/tmp+) by typing:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
cd /tmp
tar -zxvf /usr/share/doc/fluidity/examples.tar.gz
\end{lstlisting}

Change into an examples directory (top\_hat is suggested as a straightforward
starter) and run the example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
cd examples/top_hat/
make preprocess
make run
make postprocess
\end{lstlisting}

You have now run your first \fluidity model. Chapter \ref{chap:examples}
describes this and the other examples provided with \fluidity.
