\chapter*{Fluidity Primer}
% \pagenumbering{roman} \setcounter{page}{}

This is a one-page primer for obtaining \fluidity and running a simple example. It assumes that:

\begin{itemize}
\item You are running Ubuntu Linux, release 10.10 (Maverick) or newer
\item You have administrative rights on your computer
\item You know how to run a terminal with a command prompt
\item You have a directory in which you can create files
\end{itemize}

Set up your computer to access the Fluidity repository by typing:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:fluidity-core/ppa
\end{lstlisting}

Type your password when prompted.

Once this completes, update your system and install \fluidity along with its
supporting software by typing:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install fluidity
\end{lstlisting}

Now uncompress the packaged examples to a directory in which you can create
files (in this example, \lstinline[language=Bash]+/tmp+) by typing:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
cd /tmp
tar -zxvf /usr/share/doc/fluidity/examples.tar.gz
\end{lstlisting}

Change into an examples directory (top\_hat is suggested as a straightforward
starter) and run the example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
cd examples/top_hat/
make preprocess
make run
make postprocess
\end{lstlisting}

You have now run your first \fluidity model. Chapter \ref{chap:examples}
describes this and the other examples provided with \fluidity.
