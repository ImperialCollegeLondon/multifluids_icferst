Description: A schema-driven interface for writing XML documents
 Diamond is a dynamic schema-driven graphical user interface for writing
 XML documents. The interface is automatically generated from a schema
 written in RELAX NG describing an XML language. The interface is optimised
 for configuring models for solving problems in computational mechanics,
 though the technology is generic to any sort of XML document creation.

Description: An automatic options system for scientific models.
 Spud is an automatic options system which reads an xml options file 
 into a dictionary for immediate access from within the model. The xml 
 file is generated using a spud-compatible RELAX NG schema and a
 schema-aware editor such as Diamond.

 Spud is an automatic options system which reads an xml options file 
 into a dictionary for immediate access from within the model. The xml 
 file is generated using a spud-compatible RELAX NG schema and a

 for the spud base language and the spud-preprocess script for
 converting schemas between the compact and xml syntaxes.
