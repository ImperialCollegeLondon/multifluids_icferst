Instructions compiled with extensive help from Giannis Nikiteas

1) During compilation, use the debugging flag as shown below:

./configure --enable-2d-adaptivity --enable-debugging

2) make all files as normal 

3) In VSCode, install the following extensions:
3a) Modern FORTRAN (official)
3b) C/C++ (official)
3c) FORTRAN breakpoint support by ekibun
Note: do not install FORTRAN IntelliSense even if you are prompted. The extension is deprecated.

4) In the 'Run and Debug' section (ctrl + shift + D), create a launch.json file

5) Use the following launch.json format below:

{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "ICFERST debug",
        "type": "cppdbg",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/bin/icferst",
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/ACH0_5/",
        "args": ["v3", "PUB_ACH0_5.mpml"],
        "stopAtEntry": false,
        "environment": [],
        "externalConsole": false,
        "MIMode": "gdb",
        "setupCommands": [
          {
            "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
            "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
            "ignoreFailures": true
          }
        ] 
      }
    ]
  }
  

Note: 
VSCode automatically defines the 'workspaceFolder' based on where IC-FERST is being debugged
'cwd' is the current working directory where the Test mpml file is located
'args' defines the mpml file. The 'v3' flag is a native IC-FERST flag for enabling all outputs
